# Kids Short Story Network

A child-friendly social platform where children can create and share short stories in a safe and creative digital environment.

This project explores how social interaction, creativity, and parental oversight can be combined in a simplified web application tailored to young users.

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Most existing social media platforms are not designed for children.  
This project investigates how we can design a digital space that:

- Encourages creativity and storytelling
- Supports safe peer interaction
- Reduces cognitive complexity
- Allows parental oversight

---

## 📚 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a course in UI programming and architectures (MH130) at Høyskolen Kristiania. The assignment focused on designing and implementing a social media network for children, with a structured frontend application focusing on clear separation of concerns based on the target group.

## 👥 User Roles

The platform includes two primary user types:

- 👧 Child user  
  - Create and publish short stories  
  - View stories shared by friends  

- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent user  
  - Access a parent console  
  - Monitor activity and usage
  - Control connections to other users/children

## 🧠 Architecture & Technical Structure

The application follows a structured JavaScript architecture inspired by MVC principles:

- **Model** – Manages application data  
- **View** – Handles UI rendering  
- **Controller** – Connects logic and user interaction  
- **Observer pattern** – Keeps components synchronized  

This structure improves separation of concerns and maintainability.
